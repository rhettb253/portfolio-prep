## Getting myself set up with notes and assets for my future portfolio page.

Title: Coding for Contingencies, Visionaries, and the Future.

Headline: I am a Software Developer who enjoys and has a successful history working with teams. I track my workload with diligence. I want my work to be creative and important. All while making the workspace as fun as possible.

Pro Pitch: Hi! My name is Rhett Beardemphl. I am a software developer rehearsed in full stack web development via JavaScript and server side development via Python. 

When the pandemic hit, I found myself in the middle of careers without a plan of action. In my life currently, I have a family looming on the horizon and even with my old life I never would have been able to support more than just myself comfortably. Software Development is giving me the opportunity to take care of those around me and so much more. I have seen it change me as a person. I’ve found myself unusually driven to achieve this sole task of becoming a developer. A wise man once said, “someone who does many things has yet to find his way, but someone who does few things with a lot of conviction is becoming a person of purpose.” This is the transformation I have felt in myself since diving into coding and development and I am excited and grateful for this transformation and I hope I get to continue on in this domain for a long time so I can continue to grow as a person and programmer.

When it comes to the act of programming itself, I enjoy the challenging puzzles and creative thinking that development presents me with everyday. When I get a breakthrough to occur it's an awesome and rewarding experience that drives me forward. 

My core skills come from having previously worked on and managed teams. This motivates me to find an ideal environment where everyone on the team supports and teaches each other. Everyone of us would get to grow become better at our craft, synergistically. An environment like this would help me reach both of my goals. One of which is to become a specialized and skillful individual who is a needed piece of company and/or project. And the other is to continually grow and get better as a person and developer.
